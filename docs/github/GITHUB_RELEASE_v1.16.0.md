# REslava.Result v1.16.0 — NuGet Package READMEs

> **Each package now has its own focused NuGet README — designed for discoverability on NuGet.org.**

---

## What's Changed

### Tailored NuGet READMEs

Previously, all 3 packages shared the same 800+ line GitHub README as their NuGet README. Developers comparison-shopping on NuGet.org need to understand a package in 30 seconds — not scroll through a full documentation site.

Each package now has its own focused README (~60-75 lines):

- **REslava.Result** — Why this library, before/after code comparison, quick start, companion package links
- **REslava.Result.SourceGenerators** — SmartEndpoints showcase, before/after endpoint generation, quick start
- **REslava.Result.Analyzers** — Diagnostic rules table, code fix examples, zero-config install

The full GitHub README remains unchanged as the comprehensive documentation.
